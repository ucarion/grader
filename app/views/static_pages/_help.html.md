## Your first submission

This brief tutorial quickly shows you how to create an account, enroll in a
course, and submit your first program assignment.

1. **Sign up** &mdash; To complete your first program assignment, you must first
   create an account. To do so, click on the "Sign up" link at the top right (or
   just click [here](/signup)).

   Create an account by filling in your full name and email (don't mess around
   here; your instructor will see these details and your email will be used for
   contacting purposes).

2. **Sign in** &mdash; If you've just signed up, you should be signed into your
   new user already. If you aren't signed in yet, click on the "sign in" link at
   the top right of the page and enter your email and password to log in.

3. **Enroll** &mdash; Go to the enroll page by clicking on "Grader" at the top
   left and then clicking on the "Enroll in a course" button. If you're lazy you
   can just follow this link [here](/courses/enroll).

   Your teacher should have given you an "enroll key" to join your course. Enter
   this key into the dialog and submit. You should be redirected to the course,
   and a message will confirm that you've been enrolled.

4. **Find your assignment** &mdash; The course page lists all the assignments
   for that course (just because they're there doesn't mean they're due anytime
   soon, though). Find the assignment you want to submit to and click on its
   name.

5. **Create your submission** &mdash; Now that you're looking at an assignment,
   a blue button at the top right invites you to create a submission. Click on
   this button.

   Hopefully you've already got a program ready to submit. If you don't, make
   one now.

   Click on the "Choose File" button and navigate to the file you want to
   submit. Click "open" to select it. Mark this file as your "Main" file and
   click on the button that says "Create Submission".

6. **That's it** &mdash; You should now see your submission on the webpage. In
   the next few moments, your program will be automatically tested and the
   result of those tests will be shown to you.

   If your program is marked as having "Tests failed", this means your program
   has a mistake in it and is producing the wrong output. Fix the bugs in your
   program, then click "Resubmit your submission" at the top right. This will
   let you update your submission.

   Be careful not to re-submit your submissions too many times! There is a limit
   to how many attempts you can make. If you run out of attempts, talk to your
   teacher; they might give you extra attempts if you need them.

   At the top-center of the page, next to your name, you'll be able to see
   whether your program passed automated testing, what grade your teacher has
   given you, and how many attempts you've made at this assignment.

   Have fun coding!
